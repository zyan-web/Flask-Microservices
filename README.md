# Flask-Microservices
This repository demonstrates a simple microservices-based architecture using Docker, Docker Compose, and Flask. The project contains five independent services, each running as a containerized web application. It serves as a hands-on example for understanding how to build, deploy, and orchestrate microservices using Docker.
